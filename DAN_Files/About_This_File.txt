DANs (Dynamic Associative Networks) are a type of AI Architecture that takes advantage of the distribution of its training data when being 
constructed. These models are about as simple as they get, as they do not require backpropigation to be trained. On top of this, the wiring 
schematic dynamically evolves with the addition of new data. There is much more to be said about these models, for more information, 
go to this website: https://www.afbeavers.net/drg. The models in this folder are meant to highlight the incredible capabilities of 
these architectures, despite their simplicity. While the programming work displayed here is my own, it is contribuatory to the DAN Research program and DAN architecture as envisioned by Dr. Anthony F. Beavers @ Indiana University, with whom I share partial credit.
