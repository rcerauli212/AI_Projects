DANs are a type of AI Architecture that takes advantage of the distribution of its training data when being constructed. These models
are about as simple as they get, as they do not require backpropigation to be trained. On top of this, the wiring schematic dynamically 
evolves with the addition of new data, no training required. There is much more to be said about these models, for more information, 
go to this website: https://www.afbeavers.net/drg. The models in this folder are meant to highlight the incredible capabilities of 
these architectures, despite their simplicity. While the work displayed here is my own, credit to all of the development, research, 
and philosophical endeavors that went into studying this architecture entirely go to Dr. Anthony Beavers @ Indiana University
